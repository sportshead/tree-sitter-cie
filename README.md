# tree-sitter-cie

Part of my [larger project](https://github.com/sportshead/cie-pseudocode) to provide language tooling for Cambridge IGCSE/A Level Computer Science pseudocode.

This currently only supports IGCSE syntax. A Level syntax support is planned, but is slightly different and incompatible, so will probably have a different file extension.

## Usage

For use in neovim, see the accompanying [neovim plugin](https://github.com/sportshead/cie.nvim).
